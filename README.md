# 🧠 Tuberculosis Detection using CNNs (LeNet, DenseNet, WideResNet, AlexNet)

Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (TB) poses a critical challenge to global health. In this project, we leverage deep learning techniques to detect TB from chest X-ray (CXR) images using multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures — **LeNet**, **DenseNet**, **WideResNet**, and **AlexNet**.

Our approach combines radiological features from CXR images with powerful CNN models to improve diagnostic accuracy.
